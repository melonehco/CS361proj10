[COMPLETED]•  Minor problems (no points taken off this time):
    [COMPLETED]◦     Your completeIntConstToken method, near the end, parses the string and tests whether the resulting
        value is negative. How can the value be negative? Can you give me an example of a string of integers
        where parsing it gives a negative value? If not, you should remove that case and change the error
        message for the NumberFormatException case to be more descriptive of the actual problem.
    [COMPLETED]◦     In ToolbarController, on line 109 you should save the ErrorHandler in a local variable and then on line
        127, ask the ErrorHandler for the list of errors, rather than asking the scanner.

•  Your scan() method is about 180 lines long. That is too long for an elegant method. It needs to be broken
into smaller methods. For example, just as you have a method for handling string tokens, add a method
for handling operators.

[COMPLETED]•  Your scanner doesn’t accept “\”” as a legal string token.

•  Your use of a buffer in the scan() method is not the most elegant way to implement the method. You can
get rid of the buffer if you just fix the scan method so that it has the following invariant: The value of
this.currentChar at the end of the scan() method is always the first character of the rest of the source file
(that is, that part of the source file after the previous Token was returned). So make sure that, before
scan() returns a Token, it has advanced currentChar to the first char after the Token being returned.
